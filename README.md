# SMS Sagaia One Button Attack Patch
A patch for the Sega Master System game Sagaia, by Taito, that changes the controls.

In the unpathed version, one must use both the 1 and 2 buttons in order to fire both your
downward-facing bombs and your front-facing shots. Due to the shape of the controller on
a real Master System/Mark III this can be incredibly awkward and painful to do for the entire
30 minute or so run of the game. 

This patch alters the controls so that one must only press the 1 button in order to fire both
the downward-facing bombs and forward-facing shots. In addition, button 2 now act as a pause
button. However, in its current stage, it will not act as an unpause button, and instead the 
pause button on the console must be pressed in order to resume play.
